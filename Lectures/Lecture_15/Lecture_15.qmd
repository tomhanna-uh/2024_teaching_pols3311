## Culture and Development

- In trying to determine the causes of democracy and economic development, one possibility is that some other factor accounts for both.


## Culture and Development

- In trying to determine the causes of democracy and economic development, one possibility is that some other factor accounts for both.
- One fairly compelling theory is that the something else was **urbanization** which led to increased **literacy** and **numeracy** as part of expanding trade
- Other factors include **path dependence**, **culture**, and **evolutionary processes**



## Something else

"...events during critical historical junctures can lead to divergent political--economic development paths, some leading to prosperity and democracy, others to relative poverty and non-democracy."[^1]

[^1]: Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson. "Reevaluating the Modernization Hypothesis." 2009.

What are those paths? What is the something else?

## Something else

-   Cultural - Norms
-   Cultural - Institutions
-   Geographic / Resources
-   Evolutionary process

## Something else: Cultural - Norms

Protestantism (example)


## Something else: Cultural - Norms

Protestantism (example)

       
- Protestant countries/regions outperform Catholic ones on both economic and political development


## Something else: Cultural - Norms

Protestantism (example)

       
- Protestant countries/regions outperform Catholic ones on both economic and political development


-   This is a measurable effect, starting with Western Europe, but why?

## Something else: Cultural - Norms

Protestantism (example)


-   Norms based explanations (better behavior)
-  Institutions based explanations (better institutions)

## Protestantism - norms based

Norms based explanations (better behavior)

- Work ethic 

        - Max Weber
        - Work as a social obligation and a sign of grace (salvation)
        - combined with: "accumulation of capital through ascetic compulsion to save” (Weber 1905)
              

## Protestantism - norms based

- Work ethic               
- Focus on individual

        - The protestant focus on the individual's direct relationship with God, rather than through the hierarchy, undermined the divine right of kings
        
## Protestantism - norms based

- Work ethic               
- Focus on individual
- Importance of literacy 

        - Protestant emphasis on reading the Bible for oneself led to higher literacy rates
        - Literacy is important for commerce- contracts, etc.
        - Literacy is important for democracy


## Protestantism - institutions based

- Germanic institutions (including Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian) were more democratic than Roman institutions
- This predated the Reformation, but coincided geographically in many cases

## Protestantism - institutions based

- Woodberry (2012) found that Protestant missionaries were associated with higher levels of democracy and economic development in the areas they worked^[Woodberry, Robert D. 2012. “The Missionary Roots of Liberal Democracy.” The American political science review 106(2): 244–274.]

        - religious liberty
        
## Protestantism - institutions based

- Woodberry (2012) found that Protestant missionaries were associated with higher levels of democracy and economic development in the areas they worked

        - religious liberty
        - mass education

        - religious liberty
        - mass education
        - mass printing including newspapers

## Protestantism - institutions based

- Woodberry (2012) found that Protestant missionaries were associated with higher levels of democracy and economic development in the areas they worked

        - religious liberty
        - mass education
        - mass printing including newspapers
        - voluntary organizations (civil society)

        - voluntary organizations (civil society)
        - colonial reforms
        
## Protestantism - institutions based

Colonial reforms (Mostly studied in British context)

        - Protestant missionaries attempted to reform local customs
        
## Protestantism - institutions based

Colonial reforms (Woodberry 2012)

        - Protestant missionaries attempted to reform local customs
        - Locals responded by copying the missionary institutions (schools, newspapers, etc.) to resist the reforms
        
## Protestantism - institutions based

Colonial reforms

        - Protestant missionaries attempted to reform local customs
        - Locals responded by copying the missionary institutions (schools, newspapers, etc.) to resist the reforms
        - As long as the organizations were not anti-British they were tolerated by the colonial rulers
        
## Protestantism - institutions based

Colonial reforms

        - Protestant missionaries attempted to reform local customs
        - Locals responded by copying the missionary institutions (schools, newspapers, etc.) to resist the reforms
        - As long as the organizations were not anti-British they were tolerated by the colonial rulers
        - These organizations became the basis for civil society in the post-colonial period

## Protestantism - institutions based

Colonial reforms

Essentially, the argument is that the British did two things:

        - Provided examples of civil society institutions
        - Picked their battles     

The second especially was intended to maintain British control, not for benevelent reasons. But the result was that former colonies inherited positive institutions.  
        

## Something else: Evolutionary process

Open access order development (North, Wallis, and Weingast 2009)

      
            - Autocracy develops to control violence
            - Constraining institutions develop in autocracy
            - Strong but constrained autocracies perform best economically
            - The most constrained are also closest to modern liberal democracy, by definition
            - End stage is "open access social orders"

## Something else: Evolutionary process

The Narrow Corridor (Acemoglu and Robinson 2019)

        
            - strong government with strong civil society constraints required to end up with a free society
            - Strong government provides security 
            - Informal (civil society) constraints provide security against government
            - Formal institutional constraints need informal civil society to make them effective
            - The combination of strong government and counterbalancing civil society allows for both economic and political development


## Something else: Evolutionary process

Spontaneous order (Hayek 1972) - Law, Legislation and Liberty, Vol. 1 Rules & Order

       
            - Hayek's model is English common law
            - Under common law, law is found not made

            - Hayek's model is English common law
            - Under common law, law is found not made  
            - The law is found in existing customs regarding property rights, contracts, etc.

            - Spontaneous development of contract customs into enforceable institutions
