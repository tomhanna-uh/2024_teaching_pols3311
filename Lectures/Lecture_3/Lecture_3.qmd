**Elinor Ostrom 1933-2012**

## Collective choice

![](ostrom_a.jpg)

**"...the theory of collective action is** \textbf{\textit{the}} central subject of political science."

**"core justification for the state"**

## Collective choice

-   "core justification for the state" - Ostrom
-   More *generalizable* than studying the state: includes state alternatives, entities in failed states, competing states, non-state entities, quasi-state entities
-   Irrational results of group action


## Why is collective choice a problem?

-   Collective vs private goods


              - Optimal use - externalities in private goods
              - Efficient use - incentives in collective goods


-   Rational individual choices don't sum to rational group outcomes for either set of problems for different reasons

-   Examples in collective goods:

        
              - Prisoner's dilemma 
              - Arrow's impossibility theorem
