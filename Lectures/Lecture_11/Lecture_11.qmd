        - If you need to leave early, please do not leave during the last five minutes while class is wrapping up as that is the most disruptive time

## Policy Areas: Legislature's and the investment environment

Legislatures with active opposition are associated with improved investment environments. What might explain that?


## Legislature's and the investment environment

Legislatures with active opposition are associated with improved investment environments.^[1. Wright, Joseph. 2008. “Do authoritarian institutions constrain? How legislatures affect economic growth and investment.” American journal of political science 52(2): 322–343.] What might explain that?

        - Less expropriation/arbitrary taxation - better property rights and rule of law
        - More predictable policy / better stability
        - Less threat of mass unrest
        - The legislature is regulating something that is important to investors and outside the major concerns of the ruling elite
        

        
## Legislature's and the investment environment

Legislatures with active opposition are associated with improved investment environments. What might explain that?

- Wright (2008) thought that it was about risk of expropriation, confiscation of property by the regime

Would the dictator want to give up the options of confiscation and taxation? Under what circumstances?

- Corporate governance^[Jensen, Nathan M., Edmund Malesky, and Stephen Weymouth. 2014. “Unbundling the Relationship between Authoritarian Legislatures and Political Risk.” British journal of political science 44(3): 655–684.]

        - Provides a forum for "horse trading" between the private parties that have an interest in the rules
        - Takes those rules out of the hands of the dictator and ruling elite
        - Provides a measure of security to investors that corporate governance will be stable
        - Does not address more general property rights or rule of law concerns
