## Updates and announcements

- Class dismissal time 

        - University policy is ten minutes to the hour or half-hour regardless of class length
        - Most classes are 90-minutes anyway
        - If you need to leave early, please do not leave during the last five minutes while class is wrapping up as that is the most disruptive time
        
## Updates and announcements       
        
- Written assignments 

        - If you need to leave before I collect them, just leave them up front 
        - Many of these are intended to be thinking exercises where the process matters more than the final answer
        - There will be some to check reading done before class, especially with the articles for discussion

        - Review session will be Wednesday and will focus on important points and your questions, so check out the review before then
        - Some midterm questions will be intended to challenge you to apply, analyze, and evaluate, not just memorize

## Why do dictatorships have legislatures, elections, and opposition parties?
