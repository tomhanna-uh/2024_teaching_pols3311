# What is politics?

## Discussion - Writing

## What is politics? Common thoughts

- **Expensive or involves large amounts of money**
- **Distant**
- **Involves politicians or campaigns**
- **involves voting or decision making**
- **Involves rights**
- **National borders**

## What is politics? 


- **Politics is the process of making collective decisions in the context of...**

The State

## What is "the state"?

**The organized, coercive use of violent force commonly accepted as legitimate** 

- Violent force
- Legitimacy
        
## Other organizations - legitimacy

- Family
- Church
- Community organizations (voluntary)
- Businesses

## Other organizations - violence

- Organized crime
- vigilantes
- terrorists

## What is "the state"?

**The organized, coercive use of violent force commonly accepted as legitimate** 

        - Do our findings apply to other behavior (the firm, markets, voluntary organizations, churches)?

        - Can non-state organizations provide examples to understand the state?

        - What about the interaction between the state and non-state entities?




## Political Science is:

**"...the theory of collective action is the central subject of political science."**

**collective action is the "core justification for the state"**

- Elinor Ostrom
        
        - Nobel Prize in Economics, 2009 for her work on economic governance of the commons
        - President, American Political Science Association, 1996- 1997


## Political science is distinct from:

- **Economics** - also studies *collective action* in the context of voluntary exchange and spontaneous order
- **Sociology** - also studies *collective action* in the context of social norms and social structures (may also be spontaneous orders)

## Political science also distinct from:

- **Psychology** - individual behavior and cognition
- **Social Psychology** - individual behavior and cognition in the context of social norms and social structures

# What is Comparative Politics?

## What is Comparative Politics?

- John Stuart Mill (1806-1873): Method of Difference and Method of Similarity (First step)

- Size of study

            - Case study (few cases, small-n) (Method of Difference and Method of Similarity)
            - Quantitative (many cases, large-n), variation is important
            
- Type of study 

            - Examine variables that are similar or different to one another
            - Examine variables across time or geographic differences 
            - Compare different states, regions, etc.
            - Compare the same state, etc. at different times
            
            
            
## What is Comparative Politics? Method of Difference and Method of Similarity

**Method of Difference**

        
            - Starts with states that differ in the dependent variable result (the outcome)
            - They should be as similar in everything else as possible
            - Find the one other thing that is different
            - That is the cause


**Method of Similarity**
      
            - Starts with states with the same dependent variable result (outcome)
            - They should be as different in everything else as possible
            - Find the one other thing that is the same
            - That is the cause
