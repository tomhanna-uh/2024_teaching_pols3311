# Electoral Systems 

## Overview: Types of electoral and party systems

-   Why measure electoral systems? What might we be measuring?

-   Simple models of outcomes (Hotelling, Downs, Duverger)

      + What is a model? Why use simple models? Simple models in the real world?


-   Dimensions of electoral systems

      + Majoritarian vs Proportional
      + Types of Proportional



## Why we study it - Normative concerns

**Broad representation and avoiding extremism**

**Powell**: "This work is explicitly driven by a normative concern: the claim of democracies to be governments in which the people participate in policy making." **Broad proportional representation of all positions**

**Cox**: "the degree to which they create either centripetal or centrifugal incentives. Centripetal incentives lead political parties (or candidates) to advocate centrist policies; centrifugal incentives, on the other hand, lead to the advocacy of more or less extreme positions." **Extremism versus centrism**

## The normative concerns

- These two normative concerns represent a trade-off
- Science can not tell use which is more important
- Science can tell us how systems work in terms of encouraging broad representation, centifugal, and centripetal incentives


## Major focus

**Given the broad normative concerns, the major focus:**

-   **is not** about individual parliamentary seats

-   **Is** about electing Head of Government

              + About President in Presidential systems
              + About Prime Minister in Parliamentary systems

-   **Is** about total balance of power in parliament in both systems

## What is a model? Why a simple model?

-   A model is an abstract way of conceptualizing behavior
-   A model ideally is measurable with real data
-   Simplest possible model - one effect a time
-   How can we test or examine a simple model in the real world?

## Hotelling's Main Street Model

-   Hotelling's Main Street Model is a simple model of competition

            + Model of two businesses used as analogy for two candidates/parties
            + Important assumption: A single road (Main Street) 
            + Important assumption: two businesses 
            + Important assumption: balanced geographic population distribution 
            
            + Principle of minimum differentiation or "Hotelling's law"
            

## Median Voter Theorem - Black 1948/Downs 1957

**Assumptions:**

1 - two candidates

2 - a single dimension of ideology

3 - Majority rule[^1]

[^1]: Technically the election is required to satisfy the *Condorcet winner criterion*. A simple majority system is the simplest way to do this.

4 - "single peak" for individual voters ideological preferences


## Median Voter Theorem - Black 1948/Downs 1957

**Any electoral system which meets the key assumptions will elect the candidate closest to the median voter.**


## How do we end up on Main Street?

**How do we end up in an election that is comparable to Hotelling's description of Main Street for businesses?**

Alternately: How do we end up with two non-trivial parties/candidates to satisfy assumption 1 of Median Voter Theorem?

## How do we end up on Main Street?

**de jure** - legal limits allowing only two candidates

**de facto** - some feature of the system results in two parties

## How do we end up on Main Street?

**de jure** - legal limits allowing only two candidates

This is almost never the reason.

**de facto** - Features of the system, such as...

## Duverger's Law

**Duverger's Law**: Single ballot majoritarian systems[^2] with single member districts tend to produce strong two party systems.

[^2]: The strongest form of these are First Past the Post systems which require only a plurality

            - Parties have incentive to concentrate effort
            - Voters have incentive to vote for a likely winning second choice over a likely losing first choice




## Dimensions of electoral systems

1.  Number of members in district (District magnitude)

2.  Ballot structure 

3.  Number of competitors 

4.  Allocation of seats


## Dimensions of electoral systems

1.  Number of members in district (District magnitude)

Examples:

        -   District Magnitude 1 - voters choose a single seat. US House of Representatives, UK House of Commons
        -   District magnitude 400 - South Africa. All voters select all 400 members of Parliament
        -   District magnitude 150 - Netherlands. All voters select all 150 seats.
        
More Examples:

        -   US Electoral College - Texas (38 House Members)
        -   US Electoral College - Alaska (1 House Member)
        -   Northern Irish Assembly - all districts elect 5 members
        -   US Senate

## Dimensions of electoral systems

1.  Number of members in district (District magnitude)

2.  Ballot structure 

        - Number of votes per voter
        - Partial abstention allowed?
        - Cumulative votes (in multiple member districts)
        - Runoff or no runoff, ranked choice

## Dimensions of electoral systems

3.  Number of competitors 

4.  Allocation of seats

        - Majoritarian
        - Proportional: Open list or closed list


## Dimensions of electoral systems: Majoritarian 

### Majoritarian

**First past the post** (FPTP)

- simplest majoritarian system (not only)
- voting by candidate
- one seat per district (one winner is seated per district)
- one vote per voter
- highest vote getter wins (plurality)
- no runoff


## Dimensions of electoral systems:

### Proportional representation
        
- Multiple member districts (magnitude 2+)
- Seats awarded proportional to vote received by the party
- Voters may choose parties (closed list) or may choose parties and candidates (open list)

## Proportional representation: Apportionment of votes

-   May be a minimum vote threshhold
-   Different methods benefit different size parties
-   largest remainder method - example, Hare quota method

Exceeding $\frac{totalvotes}{totalseats}$ guarantees a seat

-   Divisor methods - example, d'Hondt method

$quot = \frac{V}{s + 1}$

V = total votes received by party; s = number of seats party received so far; Largest quotient gets the next seat

## Apportionment

Election outcome

-   Orange 221 votes

-   Green 123 votes

-   Yellow 97 votes

-   Total Votes: 441

-   Total seats: 25






## Recap: Majoritarian vs Proportional Representation

     
- Proportional represetnation (PR) has multiple member districts; Majoritarian has single member districts
- PR is allocated according to the percent of vote the party receives; in M the winner gets the seat
- PR has two major subtypes - open list and closed list
            
             Closed list, the party picks which candidate is seated; open list, the voters choose the party and the candidate.
            - Do not confuse open list with primaries which are a feature of Majoritarian systems
            
- PR is more likely to have multiple parties; M is more likely to have two parties (Duverger's law)
