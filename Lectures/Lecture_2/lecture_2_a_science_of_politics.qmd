## Overview

-   what is science?

-   Applying science to human behavior

-   More on the comparative method

-   Good Scientific questions

## Followup from Monday

-   Politics main concern isn't necessarily the welfare of the people. Why do I emphasize this?

          - You can't assume the state is representative of all the people or even cares about "the people's interests" - not every state is a democracy and not every democracy functions properly
          - You can't assume the state or political actors are benevolent
          - If we want to analyze how the world works, we can't start with bad assumptions
          - We may be concerned with the welfare of the people, but assuming others always are is bad science

-   Scientific questions - will cover today


## What is science?

-   Based on proof
-   Scientific Method
-   Falsifiability

## What is science? Based on proof

-   *Positive* not *normative*

-   Based on physical proof that can be empirically tested

-   About explaining the world as it is

-   Not based on ideas about what "should be"

## What is science? Scientific Method

1.  Define a *research question*

2.  Make predictions - *hypothesis*

3.  Gather *data*

                 + Experiments
                 + Observations 

4.  Analyze the data to *test* the hypothesis

5.  Draw conclusions

## What is science?

**Falsifiability - testing the hypothesis**

-   Karl Popper (1902-1994) - critical rationalism
-   hypotheses (pl.) should be testable **empirically**
-   false hypotheses are *rejected*
-   hypotheses not rejected are *confirmed* as *approximately true*

## More on the comparative method

**Types of research**

-   Experiment - random assignment, manipulation, control and treatment group

-   Observational

                  + Case study (single case, n = 1)
                  + Comparative (small-n, can be large-n)
                  + Statisticial (large-n)

## Research Questions: The First Step

**Non-scientific questions:**

        + Did the decision repealing Roe v Wade violate rights? (Political Philosophy - POLS 3310, 3349, 4344)
        + Was this case properly decided legally? (Law - POLS 3356,3357)
        + Is there a right to abortion in the Constitution? (Law - POLS 3356,3357)
        + When does life begin? (Philosopy/Theology - PHIL 1301, PHIL3351)
        + Should Samuel Alito be impeached?  (American politics/Constitutional Law - POLS 3364,3356)
        + Should Harry Blackmun be canonized? (Theology - Check with the appopriate church)

## Research Questions: The First Step

**Good scientific questions**

1.  About cause and effect

                 + "Does X cause Y?" 
                 + "What causes Y?"
                 + NOT "What is the value of Y?" - just measurement

2.  Should be measurable

3.  It should be specific at least as to the outcome (Y, dependent variable)

4.  "Why" questions are most interesting: "Why do different countries adopt a different policy with regard to Y?"

## Research Questions: The First Step

**Good scientific question:**

Does the gender of litigators (lawyers) affect judicial decisions?

## Writing

- Write a research question

        - What topic are you interested in?
        - What is the dependent variable? The "Y"? The outcome?
        - Do you have an idea about the independent variable? The "X"? The cause?
        - I am here to answer your questions
        - Would anyone like to volunteer to walk through the process? *extra credit and you can leave when you're done*
