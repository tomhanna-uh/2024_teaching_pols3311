## Agenda

Monday 

        - Go over Midterm 

        - Wrap up Modernization Theory for Wednesday reading

        - Article - "Authoritarian Amendments: Legislative Institutions as Intraexecutive Constraints in Post-Soviet Russia"
        
Wednesday 

        - Modernization Theory: Daniel Treisman article, ""Economic Development and Democracy: Predispositions and Triggers"



## Midterm

- Great job
- Minor points of confusion to understand for the final

        - Parliamentary vs. Presidential systems is not about the titles "Parliament" or "President" but about the relationship between the executive and legislative branches
        - In the questions about requirements for democracy the wrong answers were things that exist in dictatorships - multiparty opposition, elections, legislatures, etc. This is part of the point of studying the dictatorships is to realize that just saying "let's have an election" does not a democracy make. 
        - In written questions, if I specifically mention concepts from class and ask you to address them, you should address them and not use some definition from another source. (This is a standard for any course.) For example, the core concepts of contestation, irreversability and repeatability, and the four rules for deciding if a country is a democracy explain why protectin of minority rights is important to a functioning democracy.
