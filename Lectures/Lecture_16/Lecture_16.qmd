## Questions

- In previous lecture, I mentioned that one explanation of the difference between Protestant and Catholic countries development was the comparison of Germanic and Roman institutions. In Italy, we see the reverse pattern. What might explain this?

- One possible answer is that the Normans were a foreign power, but they conquered England at almost the same time. Why did England develop differently?

        -  One possible answer is that the Normans were a foreign power colonial power while the northern republicans (and small monarchies) had a history of self-government.
        - This is consistent with Putnam, et al. and the idea of developing civil society.

        - Along with maintaining Roman republican institutions, they also maintained a degree of urbanization and trade that was not present in the North of Europe or the South of Italy.
        - It's actually questionable to what extent Roman Republican institutions survived in the southern European monarchies.
        - We assume they did, because the monarchies adopted the late Roman legal code but they did not adopt the system of Assembly and Senate from the early to mid Republic.

- One possible answer is that they did not bring the right institutions with them
-In the context of (later) colonization settlement versus extraction caused a difference in institutions ^[The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation Author(s): Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, James A.

- This is not the same case, but may have parallels

- In England: 

        - The first Duke of Normany was the Viking Rollo, a little over a century before the Norman Conquest of England.
        - The Norman kings were also nobles in France and remained so with a combination of Norse and Germanic institutions there as well. 
        - In England, they retained some Anglo-Saxon nobles and their institutions,
        - Their own Norse institutions were similar.

        - The Norman kings settled and took on an Italian focus
        - The foreign Norman institutions would have weakened the monarchy compared to the native institutions left over from Byzantine Imperial rule
        - There was not much attempt to bring in Norman institutions compared to England
