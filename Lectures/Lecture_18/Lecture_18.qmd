## What is repression?

What do we mean by repression?

## What is repression?

- Repression is the use of coercive force, that is physical violence, to maintain control over a population for **political purposes**

If the state is the entity with a monopoly on the legitimate use of coercive force in a certain region, what distinguishes repression from normal government action?           

## What is repression?

- Repression is the use of coercive force, that is physical violence, to maintain control over a population for **political purposes**

- Government's role is to maintain order and protect citizens. **Political purposes** is the use of force to restrict the political participation of citizens to maintain the government's power, not to protect citizens.


## Is repression limited to authoritarian regimes?

Is all use of force to limit political participation inappropriate in a democracy? If not, is there a clear line between legitimate and illegitimate use of force to limit political participation in a democracy? Is there a level or type of repression that so undermines contestation that the government can no longer be classified as democratic?
