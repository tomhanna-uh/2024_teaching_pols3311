## Previous material on dictatorships

-   Dictatorships are defined by a lack of what?

-   Dictatorship is a catch-all for regimes that are not democratic (Gandhi among others)

-   We also refer to autocracies and non-democracies (plus other terms)

-   This includes hybrid regimes between democracy and autocracy

-   **Dictatorships may have elections, legislatures, judiciaries, parties, and other features expected in democracies**

## Types by degree

-   Liberal Democracies

        
              + Liberal Democracy (VDem)
              + Consolidated Democracy (Polity)
              + Flawed Democracy (general)


-   Anocracy (Polity) / Mixed regimes / Hybrid Regimes

       
              + Electoral Democracy (Vdem)
              + Electoral Autocracy (VDem)
              + Competitive Autocracy (general)


-   Closed autocracy (VDem)

-   Autocracies (Polity)

              + 6 measures of executive recruitment, constraints, political competition, and institutional quality


-   Varieties of Democracy Project

        
              + "Question: How can the political regime overall be classified considering the competitiveness of access to power (polyarchy) as well as liberal principles?"
              + 0: Closed autocracy 
              + 1: Electoral autocracy (multi-party elections)
              + 2: Electoral democracy (free and fair, multi-party elections, lacking other features of liberal democracy)

## Motivations of Dictators

What do you think motivates dictators?

## Motivations of Dictators

What do you think motivates dictators?

The main motivation of dictators is to gain power and once in power retain that power.

## Selectorate Theory

-   Residents (full population)

-   Selectorate (S)

       
              + Nominal selectorate - Interchangeables 
              + Real selectorate - Influentials 


-   Winning Coalition (W) - Essentials

-   Goal: small W and large pool of Interchangeables

## Selectorates: Regime Classification

Democracy - large coalition regime

   
            + Large winning coalition
            + Leader uses public goods to satisfy W


Dictatorship - small coalition regime
       
            + Small winning coalition
            + Leader uses private good to satisfy W

## Dictator's Handbook: Five Rules

1.  Keep the Winning Coalition (W) small
2.  Keep the Interchangeables pool large.
3.  Redistribute from the masses to supporters (W)
4.  Pay W just enough. Satisfy but don't empower.
5.  Never redistribute from W to the masses.
