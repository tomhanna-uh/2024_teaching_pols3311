## Section 2: Short answer (5 points each)

**Pick 2 questions to answer. Answering a third does not get any additional credit. If you answer three, I will randomly choose which two to grade and you will have wasted time.**

**Answers should be three to five sentences. They should usually fit in the space provided, but you may also use the back of the page.**

1. Briefly describe what potentially happens to the head of government (Prime Minister, President, etc.) if a piece of legislation proposed by the head of government fails to pass in a Parliamentary System and in a Presidential System. Is there a difference in the process or outcome?

    </p> Answer: The key difference is that in a parliamentary system, the head of government is answerable to the parliament politically. In a Presidential system, the head of government is not answerable to the legislature. If a piece of legislation fails to pass in a presidential system, the head of government can continue to serve out their term. In a parliamentary system, the failure of a piece of legislation proposed by the government (the Prime Minister and Cabinet ministers) triggers a *vote of no confidence.* In this vote, the parliament votes on whether they have confidence in the government. If the government loses this vote, the government must resign. In almost all cases this means that new parliamentary elections are called and, after the elections, a new government is formed by the majority of the new parliament.     </p>

    

1. Briefly explain why failing to protect minority rights makes a country undemocratic being sure to mention 1) which of the three core feature of democratic elections is undermined by not protecting minority rights and 2) which of the four rules for categorizing countries as a democracy involves rights of a political minority.

<p>Answer: One of the three core features of democracy is *contestation*, which at its core is the real possibility that a bad government may lose office through elections. If a country fails to protect minority rights, it undermines contestation because it makes it more difficult for minority groups to participate in the political process. Participation takes time and resources. If minority groups political rights are not protected, they may be afraid to participate or they may even be physically prevented from participating. If minority groups economic rights (employment, property, etc.) are not protected, they may not have the resources to mount an effective challenge to the ruling party. This is important because one of the four rules for categorizing countries as a democracy is that elections are *repeatable*. That is, if a majority party wins one election, then there are no more truly *contestable* elections, the country has ceased to be a democracy if it ever was. *Note: A few people focused on other rules from the four rules, defended their position well, and got full credit. To get credit you must have mentioned the features and rules from the class material.*</p>

1. Why can science alone not decide the answer to policy questions? What can science provide? What else is needed?

<p>Science alone can not answer policy questions because it is focused on what causes certain outcomes and can not tell us which outcomes are good or bad. In making policy, the policy maker must make a moral/ethical/normative decision about what the government wants to happen. This may involve trade-offs between different groups in society, it may involve public opinion, and it may involve higher ethical/moral values. Science can provide information about the likely outcomes of different policies. This information can be used to help the policy maker make a decision. However, science can not tell the policy maker what the right decision is. The policy maker must make a decision based on the information provided by science and the things that the government, voters, and society value. </p>
<p>Notes: 1. Science absolutely can help with answers about anything data based. If there is a lack of data, that does not mean science is not valuable; it means that there is not sufficient data to give a scientific answer. The solution is to get the data - to do the science. 2. A couple of people wrote about exxperience, gut feelings, or similar things. Good use of experience is not science *per se*, but it is still fact based. If experience conflicts with science, it is wise to remember that "anecdotes are not evidence."</p>

## Section 3: Bonus (5 points - Choose one!)

**Use the space provided and back of the page as needed.**

**Choose only one question to answer. If you choose two, I will randomly pick one to grade.**

Bonus 1. In the prisoner's dilemma game, the best outcome for both players is to cooperate. However, the dominant strategy reflected by the underlined payouts is to defect. In the setup to the game it is specified that the prisoner's cannot communicate. Does this matter? Why or why not? Under what circumstances might the prisoner's communicating matter? **Explain this in terms of the payouts for the game:**


|                       | **Prisoner B Silent**   | **Prisoner B Talks**           |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Prisoner A Silent** | 1 year, 1 year          | 3 years, <u>0 years</u>        |
| **Prisoner A Talks**  | <u>0 years</u>, 3 years | <u>2 years</u>, <u>2 years</u> |


<p style="margin-bottom:10cm;">If the prisoners communicate with each other and even if they promise to cooperate, neither prisoner has any way of knowing if the other is being truthful. If nothing happens except for talking with promises to cooperate, so-called "cheap talk," when the prisoners return to the negotiation with the police, the payoffs (the potential prison sentences) have not changed. The best course of action for each prisoner in either scenario will still be to talk. This still leads to the equilibrium where both prisoners talk and both get 2 years.</p>

<p>However, if the prisoners could communicate and make binding agreements, then they could both agree to be silent and get the best outcome of 1 year each. Some specific ways this could happen include: resort to an outside enforcer like a mafia boss or organization, a reputation system where the prisoners have shared associates who will refuse to do business with a "snitch," or one prisoner having something to hold over the head of the other prisoner such as a *credible* threat to family or a credible promise of payment. Another possibility is if the two are long time associates with *credible* future plans to continue their association that make the payoff for cooperation worth more than the 1-year sentence. In the first two cases, an outside mafia style enforcer or a reputation system that discourages snitches, the prisoners communicating may not even be necessary.

Bonus 2. Allocation of seats in PR system

You have the following election outcome in a Proportional Representation system. How will the seats be allocated using a divisor method (demonstrated in class)? **Answer: I can provide a handwritten answer to anyone who is interested.**

Formula:

Divisor method: $quotient = \frac{TotalVotes}{seats + 1}$

where *seats* is the number of seats already allocated in previous rounds.

Total seats: 10

Total votes: 125 million

Green Party: 25 million

Red Party: 35 million

Orange Party: 55 million

Purple Party: 10 million
