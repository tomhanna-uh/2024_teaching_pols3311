# Final Review - Format

## General comments

- The exam is comprehensive and the second half material relies heavily on the first half concepts.
- Many of the questions will involve applying basic concepts (first half) to more advanced concepts (second half). (e.g. if you don't know the difference between public and private goods, questions related to dictators versus democracy in Selectorate theory won't make sense.)

## General comments

- Some written questions may require more critical thinking and application of concepts than the midterm to earn full credit.
- That does *NOT* mean it will be harder, as we have practiced the concepts more throughout the second half topics. They should be more familiar.

## Questions

- 35 points possible
- 25 multiple choice. 1 point each
- 3 short written questions - choose two! 5 points each
- 2 "I Know It Now" bonus questions based on Midterm. 1 point each
- 2 designated bonus questions, choose one! - 5 points (These will be hard)

## Types of questions

- Not all memorization
- You will be expected to

        - Remember basic material
        - Show understanding of basic concepts
        - Apply basic concepts to new situations
        - Analyze and evaluate based on basic concepts

##  Format

- No bluebook or scantron needed
- You can write on the test paper
- You may fill one 8.5 x 11 paged with handwritten notes, front and back **OR** use your note cards
- No other notes, books, or electronic devices are allowed to be out during the test


## Study Tips

-  Review lecture materials

  
             - Bold, italic, and capitalized words reflect major concepts 
             - Repeated items are important
             - Know the broad categories basic definitions 
    

-  Know key distinctions - how do they differ?

          

   
## Study Tips

- Check the "For your reference" section for background information/fuller understanding. I have moved this from the Readings to the Midterm Information Module
- Read the **Background Readings** if you have not already and are unclear on concepts
- Review outside resources linked in lecture materials - this will definitely help with one bonus question. Hint: William Spaniel Video

- Types by degree of autocracy-democracy. Be able to rank them in order. Be familiar with the scales.
- Motivation of dictators. What is the main motivation? How is this similar or different than democratic leaders? 
- Motivation is the basis for explaining behavior. In the written section, if you can apply concepts from the course to explain behavior based on the motivation of leaders, you will do well.

## Varieties of Dictorship (Lecture 10)

- Selectorate theory 

        - Classification in Selectorate theory. Democracy is a _____ coalition regime; dictatorship is a _____ coalition regime.
        - In Selectorate theory, dictators are more likely to use what type of goods to satisfy their winning coalition (W). Why? Democratic leaders are more likely to use what type of goods to satisfy their winning coalition (W)? Why?
        - Five Rules from Dictator's Handbook

- Why do dictatorships have legislatures, elections, and opposition parties?

- Do legislatures have any real power in dictatorship? Do they mean anything in dictatorships?
 
- Why would a dictator want to provide a channel for elite competition?

## Non-Democratic Legislatures and Parties (Lecture 11)

- Thinking about the Dictator's Handbook and Selectorate Theory, why would a dictator want to offer the opposition a seat in the legislature? 

- Legislatures with active opposition are associated with improved investment environments. What might explain that?

- Treisman points out that in all of history there have been only three country types with national income per person (GDP per capita) above $25,000 (2011 dollars). What are they? 
- One is a single nondemocracy - Singapore. What are some explanations? Is Hayek's evolutionary model relevant?
- Treisman suggests that democratization is more likely in countries with what type of economy? Why? When is the transition likely to occur?


## Culture and Development (Lecture 15, 16)

- What are some of the factors that may explain both economic development and democratization?
- What are some factors explaining the material success of Protestant countries?
- Woodberry argued that former colonies with Protestant missionary activity did better than those without. Why? What are some of the mechanisms he suggests? Which do you find most compelling and why?

## Culture and Development (Lecture 15, 16)

- Putnam focuses on the development of social capital and trust. What is social capital? What creates an environment of high social capital and high trust?

- While the number of elections has leveled off in recent years, what has increased?
- Norris claims two related trends are responsible for much democratic backsliding. What are they?

- One of these elements distinguishes it from normal punitive legal processes. What is it?
- The article by Zhukov (2023) demonstrates that repression works in preventing mass uprisings (civil war), but only in large scale use not moderate amounts. Why might moderate repression fail where harsh repression does not? What consequence of moderate repression might help explain this?

## Conflict, Trade, and Globalizatin (Lecture 19)

- Globalization (increased international trade, investment, and financial ties) have been alternately credited and blamed with improvements and deterioration in three areas that we discussed. What are they?
- Most of the evidence suggests trade reduces international conflict. What is one possible exception?

## Comparative Method (Lecture 1)

- Method of Difference and Method of Similarity
- Size of study (case study, quantitative, qualitative)
- Types of study


## Collective Choice (Lecture 3, 5)

        - What are the three solutions to collective action problems?
        - Are all collective choice problems solved politically?
        - What other fields of study are interested in collective choice problems? 
        - How do they differ from the political science approach?

## Collective Choice (Lecture 3, 5) - Thought question


> How does Arrow's impossibility theorem relate to the types of goods that are most efficiently provided by government versus private action? (Note: Efficiency is only consideration here. Considerations of fairness in considering diverse preferences also come into play. This is an example of how scientific thinking can help solve moral/ethical dilemmas. Feel free to examine the fairness aspect as well.) As an analogy, in class I gave voting on whether to have pizza, tacos, or seafood for a catered group lunch. Think about this versus ordering individually at a restaurant without voting. 
        

## Collective Choice (Lecture 3, 5) - Prisoner's Dilemma



> Under what circumstances might it matter if the prisoner's are allowed to talk? Think about this in terms of the values of the outcomes. When would talking change those values?
